1) map_reverse
transforms A \t B into B \ta\t A 
#additional separator "a" as indicator for entries with A
2) join_files
joins two files B \t A and B \t C 
3) reduce_join
groups entries by key B as follows:	B \t [every A for  B] \t [every C for B]
4) split_map
splits groups from the previous step into separate lines: A \t B \t C
#if B doesn't appear in input_AB or if B doesn't appear in input_BC, the entry is ignored
